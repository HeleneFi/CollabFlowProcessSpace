Collaboration Flows Processes and Spaces
========================================

*Wishlist for online collaboration processes, flows and spaces*

Ok, so I've been collaborating in various environments many are which have an eye on developing collaboration tools. What I imagine, what I dream of being able to do in practice is the following:

- have my own profile with all the data necessary for authentication etc etc where I list my intentions, needs/wishes and what I have to share.

- have with all the project I am engaged in held together with my pals (with all what you have listed James for the OuishareLabs project section)

- 'bring myself' and my projects into/onto various platforms or ad hoc mission oriented collaborative spaces, pin ourselves to existing maps, add ourselves to calendars etcâ€¦

- process and reprocess all forms of content external data and generated content. Starting individually and collaboratively with liquid free open text/conversation and then gradually 'conveying' or sending it for 'reprocessing' into other forms (documents, project management, mindmaps, decision tools etc) bringing structure when relevant, as well as the relevant data. Sending this content to other spaces for aggregation, curation, with 

> hull in a space of mine or collectively held all the kinds of people, projects, content and data to follow, aggregate and curate, and then send out, disseminate.

I'm thinking 'plugin', pinging, pining, RSS type of process and flow...
