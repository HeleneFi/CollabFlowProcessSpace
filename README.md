Collaboration Flows Processes & Spaces
======================================

**Wishlist for online collaboration processes, flows and spaces**

Ok, so I've been collaborating in various environments many are which have an eye on developing collaboration tools. What I imagine, what I dream of being able to do in practice is the following:

- Have my own profile with all the data necessary for authentication etc etc where I list my intentions, needs/wishes and what I have to share.
> Example linked profiles such as we developed at OuishareLabs Camp, here's [mine](http://helenefi.github.io/) or the project we had at the labscamp in 2013 personalsomething.eu... 

- Have with all the project I am engaged in held together with my pals (with all what you have listed James for the OuishareLabs project section)
> Example [movecommons](http://movecommons.org)

- 'Bring myself' and my projects into/onto various platforms or ad hoc mission oriented collaborative spaces, pin ourselves to existing maps, add ourselves to calendars etcâ€¦
> These project blocs such as [here](http://edgeryders.eu/projects) and [there](http://labs.ouishare.net/projects), I want to plug the same one everywhere and maybe tweak it 'on the spot'

- Process and reprocess all forms of content external data and generated content. Starting individually and collaboratively with liquid free open text/conversation and then gradually 'conveying' or sending it for 'reprocessing' into other forms (documents, project management, mindmaps, decision tools etc) bringing structure when relevant, as well as the relevant data. Sending this content to other spaces for aggregation, curation with editing/publishing/commenting/annotating capability. 
> Example described [here](https://github.com/HeleneFi/The_Project/blob/master/Conversation.to.Action-Pull.Platform.md). A combination of The Brain, Trello, Gincko, Loomio, Discourse

- Pull in a space of mine or collectively held all the kinds of people, projects, content and data to follow, aggregate and curate, and then send out, disseminate, activate.
> Example, a lighter version of the [pull platform described here](http://menemania.typepad.com/helene_finidori/2012/02/engaging-for-the-commons.html), or [Netention](http://www.slideshare.net/helenefinidori/introduction-to-netention)

I'm thinking 'plugin', pinging, pining, RSS type of processes and flows...
I'm thinking browser (does it make sense?) with the right plugins, processing, pulling and diffusing tools and semantic functions...
I'm thinking protocols, interoperability apps such as [zapier](https://zapier.com/)...While the super distributed semantic web is being developed?
